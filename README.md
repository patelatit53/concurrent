# concurrent
This program shows the server code that handle multiple clients. The main thread in server is given the job of accepting tcp connections.   As soon as the connection is established, the main thread creates a conversation thread. The Conversation class holds the work logic to be executed by Conversation thread. The Conversation thread reads the user name from the client and stores it as an instance variable. The Conversation thread reads the string sent from the client. It sends back the string prepended with the username to all the connected clients through their corresponding PrintWriter instances. Writer instances of all the active clients are stored in a global ArrayList. Static block is used to obtain PrintWriter for the LogFile. All message coming to the server are logged.
